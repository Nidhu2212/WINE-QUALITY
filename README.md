# WINE-QUALITY

For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:


Fixed acidity. The predominant fixed acids in wine, such as tartaric, succinic, citric, and malic acids.
Volatile acidity. The high acetic acid present in wine, which causes an unpleasant vinegar taste.
Citric acid. A weak organic acid used to increase the freshness and flavor of wine.
Residual sugar. The amount of sugar left after fermentation.
Chlorides. The amount of salt in wine. The lower chloride rate creates better quality wines.
Free sulfur dioxide. SO2 is used for preventing wine from oxidation and microbial spoilage.
Total sulfur dioxide. The amount of free and bound forms of SO2.
Density. Depends on the alcohol and sugar content. Better wines usually have lower densities.
pH. Used to check the level of acidity or alkalinity of wine.
Sulfates. An antibacterial and antioxidant agent added to wine.
Alcohol. The percentage of alcohol in wine. A higher concentration leads to better quality.
